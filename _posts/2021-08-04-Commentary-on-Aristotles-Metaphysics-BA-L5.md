Lesson 5 - Efficient Cause Opinions

Aristotle details the ways in which previous philosophers spoke about the efficient cause. He expands on the three types of philosophers in relation to motion. He also mentions their opinions on where principles come from, intellect or love. 

Those assigning unqualified cause of motion and generation
  1. The reason for positing
	  - No object changes itself (wood > chair, bronze > statue)
	  - therefore the artist is the arbiter as principle
	  - seeking source of motion
  2. Three types of philosophers
	  - All is one material, neglect motion
	  - All one, deny motion (Parmenides and Melissus) 
	    - Parmenides thinks that the senses experience multiplicity.
	  - Fire is an efficient cause
Posited an efficient cause towards the good.
  1. Expands views
	  - after seeking motion, the good is the next obvious cause
	  - answering the question, why are some animals and things created well, while others are not, motion toward the good. The material doesn't account for the goodness of a thing
  2. Failure to assign causes 
	  - Empedocles believed the good occurred by chance, but that is false because the good seems to be predictable and recreatable. 
Opinions of Principle
  1. Those who held there is one efficient cause
  2a. The cause is intellect
	  - There is an intellect that moves everything, Anaxagoras, Hermotimus
  2b. The cause is love
	  - Hesiod, Parmenides, the gods were born of love. Good springs from love, the source of all emotions.
