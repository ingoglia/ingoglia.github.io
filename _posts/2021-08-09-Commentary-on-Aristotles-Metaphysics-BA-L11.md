These are my notes on the "Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics" by St.Thomas Aquinas. The publisher is Dumb Ox Books, and the translator is John P Rowan.

Lesson 11 - A Summary of the Early Opinions about the Causes - chapter 7

Details on how the previous philosophers dealt with causes. Reviews all of the information stated in the previous lessons, with an emphasis on cause. Explains that no other causes outside of what is mentioned in the physics is proclaimed by the philosophers. Details each philosophers view on causes.

Mention of causes of the early philosophers
  - All mention of causes can be reduced to one given in 'The Physics'
  - Material cause
    - all agree there is a material cause
      - Thales and Diogenes - material principle is one or Empedocles - material principle is many
      - All 3 thought it was a physical body, Plato thinks it is incorporeal
    - Parmenides considered efficient cause
    - Plato came closest to positing the formal cause by inventing the idea. However, the idea is not in particulars, which complicates the reasoning behind it being a cause.
    - No philosopher touched on the final cause. There are some hings of entities going towards a 'good', but nothing about it relating to a cause
