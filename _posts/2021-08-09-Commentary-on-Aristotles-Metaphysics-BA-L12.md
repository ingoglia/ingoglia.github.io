These are my notes on the "Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics" by St.Thomas Aquinas. The publisher is Dumb Ox Books, and the translator is John P Rowan.

Lesson 12 - Criticism of the views about the number of material principles - chapter 8

Detailed are the criticisms of the philosophers visited in the previous chapters. He begins with the philosophers that only thought of material causes, then talks about Anaxagoras, who made some strong implications towards forms. He argues that the natural philosophers also were not consistent in their reasoning on various points. 

The natural philosophers
 - general arguments against
    - they didn't acknowledge the existence of incorporeal objects
    - attempted to ignore the concept of motion, but then also attempted to address it via generation and corruption, which is a contradiction
    - They didn't acknowledge the formal aspect of objects
 - particular arguments against
    - all but fire are the causes of things, since fire is the finest of elements, all others are incorrect
    - omits earth as a cause, since earth has large particles
    - argues that the view that something simpler is prior requires an incorporeal component, but they deny this component, contradiction results.
 - against many material causes
    - Empedocles
      - similar problems to the single material cause philosophers
      - can't have primary substances that generate one another, they should all be primary
      - can't have conflicting cause of motion
      - doesn't explain how hot turns to cold, there only exists hot things and cold things
    - Anaxagoras
      - against:
        - that things were all mixed together in the beginning is false
        - the unmixed should be prior to the mixed by most of his logic, but that is not what he states
        - by the explanation of the way things are mixed, it is implied that properties and accidents can exist separately, which is absurd
      - for:
        - He did see the mixed state as not having properties, but only the potential for properties, so that when things became unmixed, the properties would reveal themselves
        - spoke about the intellect as being separate from the matter and mixture
