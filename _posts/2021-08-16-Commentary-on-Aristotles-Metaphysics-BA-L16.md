These are my notes on the "Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics" by St.Thomas Aquinas. The publisher is Dumb Ox Books, and the translator is John P Rowan.

Lesson 16 - Arguments against the View that Ideas are Numbers - chapter 9

Aristotle argues against both Plato's view of numbers and other mathematical objects. He makes 6 arguments. 1) Things that are similar cannot cause one another. 2) one form cannot produce many forms. 3) Numbers cannot be the principles of forms. 4) Problems with mathematical forms. 5) No reason to assume mathematical objects cause forms. 6)That forms are composed of mathematical units causes issues. He then details why extensions of mathematical views cause complications. Why we cannot assume that geometric objects are the basis of sensible objects.

Against Plato's opinion of number
  1. Things that are the same do not cause each other. Sensible things are substantially numbers. If forms are numbers, then they cannot be the cause of them.
    - things do not cause one another because of their relation to each other, but instead because of cause and effect
    - sensible things are ratios of properties, as are harmonies.
    - sensible things are numbers composed of material of some kind. However, if sensibles are caused by a number, that number would have to be entirely separate and thus connected to all things, which is not what Plato believes.
  2. one number produces many numbers. Then since forms are numbers, one form produces many forms. contradiction. many to one would imply mixture, and forms cannot be mixed. Ultimately, if units have no properties, they can be neither the same or different. 
    - assume that sensibles are not mixture, but instead composed of units. 
      - If all is unit, how are units related to each other?
        - assume that units are all the same
          - then forms would differ only in size 
          - then units would be identical, but how can that be? 
        - assume units differ
          - units differ between numbers, however the same number always has the same units (one and one have the same units, but one and two have different units)
          - units differ both between each other and individually (one and one are not composed of the same units)
   3. numbers are the principles of mathematics. No reason to posit numbers as different from sensible forms, since sensible forms are numbers. Also strange to say algebra is to the forms as geometry is to the sensible.
   4. Both sensible and mathematical objects are caused by forms. Thus, two-ness would come from separate forms of two per the math and the sensible object. This would be strange though, because there would not be a unified concept of two-ness.  
   5. Why assume that number is the cause of substance coming together, there is no clear evidence of this.
   6. If numbers are the Forms and substances of things, then either units differ or conform.
     - differ - as if everything is composed of the elements, then they are not a unity
     - same - then everything would be one entity, which causes many known issues
Arguments against views on mathematical extensions
  - Plato believes that geometric objects are the causes of the sensibles
    - but the objects of geometry (point, line, surface) may be analogous to forms, they are separate from one another, and so it doesn't make sense to think of a point as contained in a line, if we are assuming that the forms of the point are contained in the forms of the line.
    - claims that line is limit of surface and point limit of line. But what is the limit of the point?
    - debate whether the limit of a line is a line or a point.
