These are my notes on the "Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics" by St.Thomas Aquinas. The publisher is Dumb Ox Books, and the translator is John P Rowan.

Lesson 3 - The Nature and Goal of Metaphysics

This lesson focuses on defining science and detailing why it is reasonable to consider certain areas of science as above practical matters and particulars. He argues that speculative science is free and divine. He concludes that it is in the best interest for humans to seek understanding of speculative science through an understanding of causes, since it is the closest we can experience to the gods.

Showing the kind of science:
Show science is dignified
  - Show that this is not a practical science, but speculative
  - The most free study
  - science is not human (of the gods)
  - most honorable science

Prove: This is a speculative science
  1. (argument) - Only science sought for its own sake is speculative. Philosophy and wisdom are for their own sake. Those who study seek wisdom (escape from ignorance)
  - Philosophers desire to know the cause of their ignorance/wonder, like a poet not for utility, but simply to know.
  - (example) Since wisdom is sought in pleasure, it isn't practical.
  2. A free person exists for themselves. Wisdom also exists for itself, and so it is a free science.
   - One interpretation, 'only this' means the speculative science, which speaks to the final cause, and so is in the highest degree.
    3. a free science cannot be possessed by something servile, humans are servile in ways therefore science isn't human. Because humans need for material things, they at times cannot pursue knowledge. Man can't know science perfectly.
    - Simonides argues that the gods envy those with knowledge.
    - Aristotle disagrees, also Plato, because gos are not capable of envy of humans, and poets lie a lot.
  4. Wisdom is the most honorable science because it is the most divine science:
    - science of god is divine
    - about divine matters is divine
    - Since this science is first-cause and principles, it is divine, as god is these things
    - god has wisdom in the highest degree
The goal of wisdom: The first and universal cause. The alleviation of wonder through understanding a cause.
