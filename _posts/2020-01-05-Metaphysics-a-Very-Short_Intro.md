I just finished reading "Metaphysics, A Very Short Introduction", by Stephen Mumford. I find these books are a good way to quickly determine how you think relative to thevery basic academic identifications:

==Nominalist or Realist==

A nominalist, very basically, is someone who believes that abstract object are not ‘real’. The color red, or the perfect sphere… these are just constructs of our language, or of our minds.

A realist is someone that believes there is some kind of existence that can be ascribed to abstract objects. That there is some ‘realness’ to concepts like perfect circles or colors.

==Reductionist or Emergentist==

A reductionist believes that everything that exists can be reduced to its parts. That we can describe the actions of all entities be listing their basic building blocks.

An emergentist is someone who believes that a whole is more than the sum of its parts. That conciousness for instance cannot be found entirely in our brain and bones, or that social dynamics are not the result of each individual that makes the group, but instead that the group think is an emergent property of the group.

==Endurantism vs Perdurantism==

Endurantism is the idea that objects retain their identity through change. That even though I had a small body when I was a child, I am still the same person now that I was then.

Perdurantism implies that we do not have an enduring self, that as we, or any other object changes its properties, that it is no longer the same thing as it once was.

==Humean vs Non-Humean==

Humean’s believe that we cannot assume that cause and effect are related.

Non-humeans believe that a cause and effect are related

==Eternalism vs Presentism==

Eternalism is the belief that past, present and future are all co-occuring and everything that has passed and has yet to pass exists at all times.

Presentism is the idea that everything is existing in the present moment. There is not past or future that exists.

This book was interesting and easy to approach with no previous knowledge about philosophy or metaphysics. I am glad I read it. I think it is a good practice to search for labels for ways of thought. Not to limit yourself, but to better find the responses to those beliefs, to test your own rationality. I say that I believe these ideas now, however I am uncertain that I will believe them tomorrow.
