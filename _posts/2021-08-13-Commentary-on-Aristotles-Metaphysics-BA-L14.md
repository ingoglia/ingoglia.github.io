These are my notes on the "Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics" by St.Thomas Aquinas. The publisher is Dumb Ox Books, and the translator is John P Rowan.

Lesson 14 - Arguments against the Platonic Ideas - chapter 9
 Aristotle breaks down five arguments against Platonic Ideas. First, by Ockham's razor, creating forms only adds complexity, which seems unnecessary. Second, there is no way to prove the existence of form. Third, since all subjects of science would be considered forms, it follows that accidents and negations would also have forms. Forth, instead of having a form for concepts like motion, he claims that motion is a type of illusion. Fifth, The Third Man argument. Sixth, issues with which number and form is most essential and prior to all. I recommend spending some time breaking down the arguments in this section, as they are a bit complicated


- substances of things
  - argues against form is substance
    - creates forms separate from material objects, but equal in number
    - form of Ockham's razor
    - argument that there are equal Ideas than particulars
      - All particulars have a Idea which they are predicated of
      - Let us assume that there is an individual existing instance of an Idea in every particular
      - then there would be a form that is paired with every particular
      - therefore there will be an equal number of Ideas and particulars
    - argument that there are more Ideas than particulars
      - assume the previous argument for equal number of Ideas and particulars
      - consider that there may be Ideas of incorporeal mathematical objects
      - consider that there may be Ideas of the genera of particular species of objects
      - therefore there would be more Ideas than particulars
    - There is no way to prove that the forms exist
    - Plato argues that since science is knowledge of necessary things, it cannot be about sensible, corruptible things, but this would imply that there are sciences relating to negations, which is problematic
    - There should be a science of corruptible things, however, Plato instead claims that corruptions are fantasy and illusions, and therefore not actually happening
    - a science of predicated relativity would imply Ideas of relations, but that is not Plato's Idea, as it isn't a shared property
    - the third man argument meanings:
      - there is a man that is ideal relative the the 2 men that are particulars of the ideal with the same name (not what Plato intended)
      - a man that is common to the ideal man and one perceived by the senses, which creates an infinite set of ideal to perceived men.
      - If you assume math objects to be intermediates to forms and particulars, you will also have to consider a man intermediate to the form of a man and it's particular.
    - for Plato, forms are prior to both mathematical and sensible objects
      - but he also says that forms are odd numbers
      - also that the dyad comes from the odd numbers
      - but the Platonists have said that the dyad is first in class of number, contradiction
      - relation would also have to have Ideas
    - there must be forms of many things outside of substances (accidents)
      - there is a complication when considering that accidents are not participated in as forms, but only separately, since they would be infinite if they were essentially the accident (doubleness as an example), but accidents by his definition must have forms, contradiction.
    - a form must exist wherever there is a commonality, ex: number 2 and double have a commonality, and that commonality should also be a form, however this creates infinite forms
    - these arguments relate to the issue of equivocation  

  - about mathematical objects
- principles of things
