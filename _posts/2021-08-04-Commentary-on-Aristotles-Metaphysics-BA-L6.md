These are my notes on the "Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics" by St.Thomas Aquinas. The publisher is Dumb Ox Books, and the translator is John P Rowan.

Lesson 6 - Love and Hate as Efficient Causes of Good and Evil

Aristotle considered the focus on opposites to be a more refined progression towards the efficient cause. He sites Empedocles and Anaxagoras as two people who had these views. He further explains however, that although they mention concepts relating to the efficient cause, it is always in passing and not well formed. 

- Contrary good and evil don't happen by chance, good is not as common as evil

- Empedocles - The good (love) aggregates the base disaggregates

1) Inadequate treatment of efficient cause in general
  - Didn't directly state concepts used them infrequently, and in consistently, accidental rather than by art.
2) In particular
  - Anaxagoras: intellect to generate. Uses it of necessity, doesn't rename consistent, witching to nature of things.
  - Empedocles: takes axioms that are not self evident. 
    - love is the dissolution of other love, there is a separation in every aggregation.
