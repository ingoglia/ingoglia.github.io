Lesson 17 - Arguments against the View that the Ideas Are Principles of Being and Knowledge - chapters 9 & 10

Argument against Plato's views of principles
  - Principles of being
    1. They didn't posit and efficient cause, and essentially denied motion.
    2. Posited forms as cause of sensible objects, but forms are separate and unrelated to matter that makes up sensibles
    3. Since forms are immobile, it seems impossible that there would be a form of motion. But if there is no motion, then how can we speak of sensibles.
    4. The substance of all things cannot be unity, as how can there be a form of unity, it creates complication and contradiction.
    5. There is no place for geometric shapes in Plato's view. They cannot be mathematical, sense, or form based. They should be considered a different class.
    6. Plato only indicated principles of substance and neglected accidents. Didn't determine the differences between things that share the same name but have different matter.
  - arguments against the ideas being the principles of science
    1. It isn't possible to have first hand knowledge of ideas, since they are not 'around' us. We can only gain knowledge of them through particulars.
    2. It seems that principles should be about things we cannot forget, like a sense of reason and qualities built into us at birth. However Plato states that the Ideas should be principles, and that we have simply 'forgotten' what we already knew. But this doesn't seem very convincing.
    3. Forms do not explain everything about a material object, as there are certain things (accidents) that are not attended to.
    4. Forms are said to be the knowledge bearers, however, how can a blind man have knowledge of color? 
  - Finishes by stating that the ancient philosophers had some good ideas about Metaphysics and about causes, but nothing that was well formed or convincing.
