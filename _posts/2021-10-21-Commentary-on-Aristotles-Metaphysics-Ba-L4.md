These are my notes on the "Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics" by St.Thomas Aquinas. The publisher is Dumb Ox Books, and the translator is John P Rowan.

Lesson 4 - The Existence of a First in Final and Formal Causes - chapter 2

This section focuses on ensuring the finitude of final causes. He gives several arguments for why there is not an infinite set of final causes, and no infinite regresses. Many of these arguments rely on our belief that we can know things, and that we can complete and become things. 

- final cause is not infinite
  - an end is the reason for what brings something to be, not the other way around. So there is not an infinite regress, since the motion is forward instead of backward.
  - If there is no final cause, then there is no good, because good = final cause. 
  - by assuming no final cause, there would be no end to actions, which would eliminate a need to do anything or take any action.
  - there would be no practical intellect if there was no final cause, since there would be know results of actions
  - species point to forms in that they are defined by the forms. To then have the forms defined by something else into infinity is absurd. Eventually you must have base definitions.
  - the relationship of forms and bodies
    1. Forms that are prior to other forms are of a larger class, and encompass more particulars. If you have an infinite set of forms, there will be no first cause, and this will eliminate all following particulars.
    2. To know a species is to know the final result of the species, if you have an infinite regress downward, towards the species, you will eliminate knowledge, as you cannot know a species without knowing the limit of it's species
    3. in order to have knowledge you need to know all of the genera and the species of a particular. Without both, you cannot know something and so there would be no knowledge. It would also be impossible to know an infinite set of genera, because we cannot comprehend true infinity.
    4. Everything that has matter is movable, and has potential motion. Matter is infinite, as is nothingness, as matter lacks form. nothingness belongs to the infinite, insofar as something that comes from matter is also subject to the reality that the subject can have lack, or malfunction
