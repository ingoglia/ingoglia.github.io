These are my notes on the "Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics" by St.Thomas Aquinas. The publisher is Dumb Ox Books, and the translator is John P Rowan.

Lesson 1 - The Dignity and Object of This Science

- Defines the science of first philosophy
  This sections begins by giving a reason why we should think about metaphysics (first philosophy). 
Aristotle argues that wisdom is a natural desire for humans, that we respect those who have it, and we wish to obtain it for ourselves. He gives examples to back his reasoning, mostly related to our appreciation of the senses. He then details the 'hierarchy of knowing', to which he explains how animals, and then rational animals come to experience 'knowing'. Some examples are sensation, memory, imagination, prudence, teachability, experience,art and science. He then defines art, experience, and science, and details their hierarchy. 

  1. Wisdom: the causes of things:
	- Explains why science is dignified (that it is naturally desired)
	  - Perfection is desired (even by immaterial)
	  - Desire of man is to understand things
	  - Desire to be part of the whole
	  - All people desire knowledge, it is only through obstruction that this is not accomplished.
	    - Take for example that humans love their senses, particularly sight:
	      - sight is more immaterial in that it does not enact force on the body
	      - sight has access to celestial bodies, making the sense superior.
	      - able to decipher differences, also to see the primarily qualities of an object.
	- Explains hierarchy of knowing (in 'On the Soul')
	  In animals:
	   1. Power of Sensation ( touch is most base, sight is least base)
	   2. Sensation, memory and imagination.
	   3. sensation, memory, imagination, and prudence (foresight)
	   4. sensation, memory, imagination, prudence and teachability (through hearing)
	  In humans:
	   1. experience (caused by memory) - Particulars
	   2. art (universal reason) - Universals
        - Why art is superior to experience:
	  - art is universal while experience is particular
	  - just recognizing a pattern is experience, while taking the pattern and creating a response to it is art.
	  - things in motion are accidental, healthy from sickness is an accidental attribute of a person.
	  - view of scientific knowledge is superior
	  - arguing as someone who doesn't know can't succeed.
	  - the object of art is universal, closer to wisdom to know
	  - art implies knowing why, while experience knows what is.
	    - example: the architect vs the constructor uses reasoning to attempt to prove opinion
	  - If teachable, then better, as ability to reproduce is essential.
	  - knowing through senses is not knowing 'why' but 'what is'
	  - compare practical (prudence and art) and speculative (science, understanding, wisdom)
	  - speculative art is superior as those with speculative knowledge are more highly esteemed
	  - cause is a subset of science
