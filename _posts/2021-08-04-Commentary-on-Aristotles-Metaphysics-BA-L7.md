These are my notes on the "Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics" by St.Thomas Aquinas. The publisher is Dumb Ox Books, and the translator is John P Rowan.

Lesson 7 - The Views of the Atomists and the Pythagoreans

1) Position - there are many principles
	a) Leucippus and Democritus -
	  - principles of things are corporeal
	  1. opinion of material cause
	    - void is non-being, full is begin. void exists and interplays with full creating continuity, all things are continuous, divided everywhere.
	  2. the cause of diversity, also generation and corruption
		- Difference if bing comes from shape(rhythm), arrangement (intercontact), position (turning)
		- Only motion is self motion, only efficient and material causes handled.
2) Position - there is only one being
	b) Pythagorean - 
	    - Substance of things
		  - math equations and entities
   		- Principles of things
		  - math principle are principles of all things 
		    - ascribed justice and soul etc. to number due to corelating and metaphor
			- harmonies and rations, harmony comes from numbers
			- saw the harmony in sound in everything
			- made up truths to fit math model, claiming a hidden planet since there are 9 visible planets, but 10 is a perfect number.
