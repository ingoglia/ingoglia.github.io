Lesson 7 - The Views of the Atomists and the Pythagoreans

The views on principles for the Atomists and Pythagoreans are detailed. The Atomists believe that many corporeal principles make of the being of all things, while the Pythagorean's believe that there is only one being, that of number. Further he claims that the Atomists err by way of annihilating motion, while the pythagoreans are inconsistent, and make up unfounded reasons to align reality with their idea of numbers and numerology.

1) Position - there are many principles
  1. Leucippus and Democritus -
	  - principles of things are corporeal
	  I. opinion of material cause
	    - void is non-being, full is begin. void exists and interplays with full creating continuity, all things are continuous, divided everywhere.
	  II. the cause of diversity, also generation and corruption
		- Difference if being comes from shape(rhythm), arrangement (inter-contact), position (turning)
		- Only motion is self motion, only efficient and material causes handled.
  2. Position - there is only one being
	Pythagorean - 
	  - Substance of things
		- math equations and entities
   	  - Principles of things
		- math principle are principles of all things 
		  - ascribed justice and soul etc. to number due to corelating and metaphor
		  - harmonies and rations, harmony comes from numbers
		  - saw the harmony in sound in everything
		  - made up truths to fit math model, claiming a hidden planet since there are 9 visible planets, but 10 is a perfect number.
