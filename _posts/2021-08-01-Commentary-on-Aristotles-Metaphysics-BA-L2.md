These are my notes on the "Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics" by St.Thomas Aquinas. The publisher is Dumb Ox Books, and the translator is John P Rowan.

Lesson 2 - Wisdom Considers Universal First Causes and First Principles 

He details the way in which wisdom can be measured, creating hierarchy by stating various relationships between types of knowledge. Offers metaphors and examples to prove his reasoning. He then begins to focus on identifying particular and universal knowledge and showing why universal knowledge retains higher value and purity. Puts for science as the highest knowledge, defined as a movement towards 'the good'. 

  - Wisdom is knowledge of causes
  - Causes and principles in wisdom
    1. Defines wisdom by different views of wise people
      - Those who have universal knowledge know more because universal is to infinite as insular is to temporal
      - knowledge not easily known is superior to knowledge of the sense or something simple
      - a feeling of certainty grants more value
      - Being able to establish cause, shows a greater knowing
      - knowledge that is not grounded in the material is more pure and therefore higher quality.
      - Better to know higher science as an architect knows more than a construction worker
      - wisdom is from master science, slave science
    2. Shows all causes are proper to the universal science
    3. draws conclusions aimed for
  - As horsemanship is to military arts the sub is guarded by the master
  - inferior artists are directed by superior ones
  - universals are known through particulars of the senses, making them more complex.
  - contradiction in physics - universals known first (first is easier) being for example
  - arithmetic before geometry
  - point adds position
  - the science of being is prior to mobile being, making it a higher science
  6 attributes:
   1. To know universal is to know something of the particular, in a sense knowing all things.
   2. The universal has less complexity and is therefore more simple, so those with more universal knowledge are simple.
   3. More certainty are less complex topics, universals are less complex then particulars.
   4. science of causes is the best to teach to teach is to cause knowledge in others. Science of the first cause is the best to teach if causes are the most teachable subject.
   5. The first principle are highest knowledge:
     a. one who desires knowledge for knowledge sake, desires scientific knowledge
     b. highest knowledge is of the most knowable
     c. science of its won sake is to do with the most knowable
     d. things knowable by other things are more fundamental and known by principles
   6. Things are known to enact final cause and the master science knows the cause
  - all science is to understand the movement towards the good.
