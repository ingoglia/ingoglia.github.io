Lesson 8 - The Pythagorean Doctrine about Contraries

More deeply focuses on Pythagorean ontology. Explains how they determine the founding principles of reality, taking odd and even as the basis for the proliferation of experience. Details also a related perspective of Alcmaeon, who uses contrary pairs as principles.

Pythagorean Principles 
 - Opinions on
   1. Number is principle of existing things, matter, and attributes of numbers are attributes of things
    - attributes = transient accidents
	- states = permanent accidents
	- example - even is justice because it divides in wholes
	- even(unlimited, division of continuous)/odd(limited), are principles of numbers
	- odd - masculine
	- even - feminine
    - Unlimited is division of the continuous, even capable of division, odd indivisible, includes a unit.
	- unity is even and odd, all contained in the unit
   2. 10 co-element principles
     1. limited and unlimited
	 2. even and odd
	 3. the one(odd) and many(even)
	 4. male and female
	 5. left and right
	 6. motion and rest
	 7. circular and straight 
   3. Many contraries are principles of things (Alcmaeon of Croton)
     - Posits contrary pairs
	 - didn't ascribe them to contraries
- Main Point: The principles of existing things are contraries (material cause)
