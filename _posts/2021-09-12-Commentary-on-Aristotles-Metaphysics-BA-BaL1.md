These are my notes on the "Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics" by St.Thomas Aquinas. The publisher is Dumb Ox Books, and the translator is John P Rowan.

Lesson 1 - The Acquisition of Truth: Its Ease and Its Difficulty - chapter 1

This section focuses on the ease and difficulty of obtaining truth. He denies the argument that objects are the sole cause of not understanding, as everything is in flux. He also touches on how people share knowledge.

Goal: Establish truth
- what belongs to a universal consideration of truth
  - ease of knowing
    - while no man can no everything, they also cant know nothing.
    - while we can know little individually, combined we know a lot
    - we all know basic truths, because without them we can know nothing
  - reasons for difficulty of know 
    - Cannot know both the parts and the whole in the same knowledge, must learn them separately.
    - not knowing can come from either an intellectual weakness, or from that object not being discernable
    - things that are incorporeal are less knowable by their nature
    - Argument that it is always the object that causes issue, as objects are always changing and cannot be known.
      - argues that this is not true, because it can also be a deficit of the senses 
      - also argues that incorporeal things are known better than the physical things, not sure how this relates
  - assistance of others in knowing truth
    - directly: someone teaching others
    - indirectly: having a conversation to elucidate the truth
