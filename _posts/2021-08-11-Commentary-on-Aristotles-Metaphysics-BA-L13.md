These are my notes on the "Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics" by St.Thomas Aquinas. The publisher is Dumb Ox Books, and the translator is John P Rowan.

Lesson 13 - Criticism of the Pythagoreans' Opinions - chapters 8 & 9

States 3 arguments against the Pythagorean perspective on the basic principles of reality. There is no explanation for motion, sensible bodies have an added layer of complexity than just number, and if there are only numbers, then how are they generated. He then mentions that Plato has 2 types of number, one that creates objects and one that generates those numbers, which makes his view more developed.

Arguments against Pythagoreans
  - took the principles of reality as objects of mathematics
  - attempted to state the causes of all things 
  - posit that all things that exist are sensible (but may not be corporeal)
  - didn't explain or allow for motion in their theory
  - sensible bodies add more to just number, but this aspect of these objects is not considered
  - believed that all substance is one type of number, contradiction as how does something generate itself
  
Plato's perspective
  - there are 2 types of number, the number which causes the the numbers in the sensible realm.
