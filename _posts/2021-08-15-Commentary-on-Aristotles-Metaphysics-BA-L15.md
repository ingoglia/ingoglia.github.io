These are my notes on the "Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics" by St.Thomas Aquinas. The publisher is Dumb Ox Books, and the translator is John P Rowan.

Lesson 15 The destruction of the Platonists Arguments for Ideas - chapter 9

This section details five arguments against Platonic Ideas. First, they don't explain motion. Second, they don't explain our knowledge of sensible things. Third, they don't stand as examples of real objects. Forth, they don't speak about the value of substance. Fifth, they say nothing about the causes of generation. 

- Aristotle believes that the forms don't contribute to sensible objects, thus defeating the argument that they are needed to describe reality
- Five arguments against arguments for ideas
  1. forms do not contribute to sensible things in motion
    - Plato believed that all sensible things are always in motion
    - wanted to posit something that is immutable to talk about concepts
  2. no explanation for knowledge of sensible things
    - to know something is to know ots substance
    - knowing the form of a substance has nothing to do with the substance itself
    - to assume the the form mixes with the sensible means that the form must exist separate to the sensible, which creates problems
  3. can't stand as exemplars
    - forms are more similar to a metaphor than to realistic philosophical thinking
    - why should we assume that all things look to an Idea to become similar to it especially if that Idea is completely separate from the sensible?
    - Gods knowledge is the exemplar of the sensible 
    - if you posit a form for each sensible, where do you draw the line, otherwise you will have many different forms pertaining to the same sensible, which could potentially be infinite.
    - if there are forms, then there would be forms of forms, but how can this be, since the properties of being a form are so different from being a sensible object.
  4. forms don't say anything about substance
    - how can a form talk about substance if it exists separately to the object
  5. says nothing about generation of causes
    - plato doesn't assume that the Idea is the efficient cause. Instead states that they are not in motion, but forms can only be brought into sensibles via motion. 
    - no reason to think that Ideas generate sensibles, as there are many artificial objects that don't have an Idea, and this can happen with natural objects as well.
