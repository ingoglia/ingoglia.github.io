My current project in philosophy is to gain a basic understanding of metaphysics. I have been working on this project for over a year now. This is part of a larger project of understanding mathematical logic, which I have been working on off and on for nearly 15 years. A substantial part of my mathematics degree was dedicated to studying set theory and the foundations of mathematics. I am not career or socially focused, and so I studied for the sake of understanding and learning.

I had always been interested in philosophy, driven to understanding deep concepts as a child. I fell in love with mathematical logic in my early 20’s, when I was exposed to Godel’s Incompleteness Theorems. I felt that I didn’t understand them, but their implications struck me so deeply that I wanted to. Little did I know that this desire for understanding would result in several years of grueling college mathematics courses, only to find that even PHD level students were confused about the proofs I was seeking to understand.

Having completed my mathematics degree, I can attest to having walked through the incompleteness theorems (with the help of a patient and inspiring professor), and obtained a basic understanding of their implications. However, there is still so much work to be done to improve my understanding. I have taken the technical skills I've learned through my formal degree, and I am excited now that I am no longer a student, to study mathematics and philosophy on my own terms.
